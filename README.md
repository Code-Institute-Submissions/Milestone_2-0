## Gitpod Reminders

For this project the Code Institute student template for Gitpod was utilized. It has preinstalled all of the 
tools needed to get started. 

To run a frontend (HTML, CSS, Javascript only) application in Gitpod, in the terminal, type:

`python3 -m http.server`

A blue button should appear to click: *Make Public*,

Another blue button should appear to click: *Open Browser*.

To run a backend Python file, type `python3 app.py`, if your Python file is named `app.py` of course.
