# Delila Kidanu - Oka Website Project for Milestone Project #1

explain the features of the application from savings features to growing features. The aim of the website
is to showcase the product and educate potential users on its benefits. The website also allows for users 
to sign up for the service and get early access.

The website has a simple flow highlightint the various featurs of the product and includes images that make
it easier for the user to visualize what the product looks like.

This website is built to support potential future customers of the Oka product to learn about the offering 
from the product. The client Oka commissioned this website to build a base following who they want to convert 
into active users once the product is launched. 

The target for this website/project is:
- Young Millenials 
- Tech Savvy individuals who are financially contious 
- Curious partners who want to learn more about the Oka product 

The tone/communication of the website is:
- Down to earth and colloquial 
- Conversational 
- Friendly 

User types:
1. As a curious potential customer, I want to learn more about Oka, so that I can determine if I want to use it. 
2. As an early adopter, I want to get first dibs on using the Oka product, so I want to sign up for early access. 
3. As a potential investor, I want to find more information about the product and test is marketability, so I want
to read and sign up early. 
4. As an early employee of Oka, I want to find out if people understand the value add of Oka, so I use the website text
as a tool to test user understanding.

## Gitpod Reminders

For this project the Code Institute student template for Gitpod was utilized. It has preinstalled all of the 
tools needed to get started. 

To run a frontend (HTML, CSS, Javascript only) application in Gitpod, in the terminal, type:

`python3 -m http.server`

A blue button should appear to click: *Make Public*,

Another blue button should appear to click: *Open Browser*.

To run a backend Python file, type `python3 app.py`, if your Python file is named `app.py` of course.

A blue button should appear to click: *Make Public*,
